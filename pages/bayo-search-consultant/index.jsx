They revolved around topics I am passionate about, politics, education, social reform, and art. But I was tired of scratching the surface and barely making an impact. I wanted to understand how to get more involved in a powerful and impactful way.   </p>

They weren’t quite sure how my managerial experience in Spain and the United States would translate over to the UK, so I was hired as a web generalist. Looking back on it, they probably wanted to save on my salary, but I thank them for slowing me down a bit. </p>

One moment I could be working on an eCommerce site helping to sell doorknobs. The next hour I could be working on a lead gen site for a charity. I was never bored. At my last count, I worked on 47 websites before I left, spread across 16 verticals. </p>
                                            <br />

If you were up for a challenge, they were happy to back you. So I took the time to remaster the basics of the web. With the experience and knowledge I brought to the table, I could improve drastically.</p>

So I sought to build a data-backed system that helps marketers get ahead of human thinking. I would design the TRAM SEO method to favor human search as much as it discusses search algorithms. </p>
