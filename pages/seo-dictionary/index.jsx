It is the subject of much debate—its existence has been written about since 2004 but not confirmed, with several statements to the contrary. <br/><br/> According to the theory of the sandbox effect, links which may normally be weighted by Google’s ranking algorithm, not least improving the position of a webpage in Google’s index, may be subjected to filtering to prevent their having a full impact. Some observations have suggested that two important factors for causing this filter to come into play are the active age of a domain, and the competitiveness of the keywords used in links. <br/><br/> Active age of a domain should not be confused with the date of registration on a domain’s WHOIS record, but instead refers to the time when Google first indexed pages on the domain. Keyword competitiveness refers to the search frequency of a word on Google search, with observation suggesting that the higher the search frequency of a word, the increasing likelihood that the sandbox filter effect will come into play. <br/><br/> While the presence of the Google Sandbox has been long debated, Google has made no direct disclosure on the matter. <br/><br/> It’s theorized that the best way to overcome the sandbox effect is to target relatively unpopular terms in the infancy of a site’s existence (point in time the site is first indexed). Otherwise, new websites that aim to rank for popular terms will be thrown to the back of the ranking queue even if they are able to attract links.  " />

The idea behind Hubs and Authorities stemmed from a particular insight into the creation of web pages when the Internet was originally forming; that is, certain web pages, known as hubs, served as large directories that were not actually authoritative in the information that they held, but were used as compilations of a broad catalog of information that led users direct to other authoritative pages. In other words, a good hub represents a page that points to many other pages, while a good authority represents a page that is linked by many different hubs.</p><br/><p>The scheme therefore assigns two scores for each page: its authority, which estimates the value of the content of the page, and its hub value, which estimates the value of its links to other pages.</p>`} />
